Bookmark Manager
===
re-doing it for the third time
---
This project builds a simple bookmark manager, which is a page that allows a user to save some URLs that they may later want to re-visit. 

I'm doing this for the third time because I find this project very helpful when learning to build online applications. It has taught me the concepts of integration and unit testing (cucumber and rspec), how to use databases (DataMapper and postgres) and how to use init gems (cucumber-sinatra).
